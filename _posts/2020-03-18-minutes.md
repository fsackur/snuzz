# Minutes 18/3/20

## Agenda

- Introductions
- Decide comms platforms (FB / whatsapp / email etc etc)
- Show infrastructure plans so far; discussion
- Virus planning
- Define lead roles
- Rough outline: budget and camp fees (both Nest and Nowhere)
- Plan any purchases with long lead times
- Most importantly, is it 'Snuz' or 'Snuzz'

## Present

- Freddie
- Paloma
- Office Desk (Nick)
- Lexy
- Becky
- Emma DB

## Group comms

- IM (Whatsapp / FB Messenger) is not suitable for important comms because too much noise
- Email is OK
- We prefer Zoom for VC

## Infrastructure plans so far

- Will rent container at Nowhere; rental and annual storage to be part of camp fees
- Showed first sketch of shade structure
- Possible upgrade of solar setup to have inverter and run mains power

## Virus planning

- Plan for nowhere as if it's going ahead
- Nest is cancelled, so we want to book a camp spot and make our own nest (working title "Notst"

## Notst

- Snuzz camp + Dead Insides + maybe some Flamin' Merkins
- Broadly agreed to use same dates as Nest, but Lou-Lou asked for it to be a week later for her birthday
- We need a max number - 30 was suggested - if we go too high, campsites won't accept us and we'll need permits
- Lexy has some campsites on the list, Hilda has one, Freddie has one
- Becky is campsite lead
- Need campsite with:
    - Toilet block
    - Running water / showers would be nice
- Electric:
    - Caravan site - don't camp in site, but run 200 metres of cable
    - Or Freddie's crappy generator
    - Upgrade solar?
- Sound:
    - Ollie, Michael both have speakers
    - Depends on who's coming
    - Can't be louder than any neighbour would notice
    - If we get one of these systems, won't be turned up past 2
    - Default is the snuzz camp boom box - but it's barely loud enough in the open
- Shelter
    - Dead insides - tent
    - Emily Poupart - dome
    - Snuzz camp - gazebo (not sufficient for 30 people in rain)
- Membership numbers
    - 20-30

## Lead roles, budget, fees and purchases not discussed due to continuing uncertainty

## Camp name

"Snuzz" it is!
