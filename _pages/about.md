## Nest 2020 (25-31 May)

- Reprise of 2019
- Now with awesome shade structure (partial)
- Brand-new off-the-peg solar system, just plug yer 3-pin shit in in like at home, now with LIGHTSWITCHES BITCHES!
- Massive overkill why? Dry run for Nowhere kit!
- Coronavirus plan: If Nest is cancelled, we'll go to a field and have a micro-nest. We'll just pick a campsite that has a big field and a toilet block.

## Nowhere 2020 (7-12 July)

- WE'RE GETTING A CONTAINER
- Shade structure at full scale
- Engineered for easy strike
- Kitchen with worktops, sink, and proper gas hob
- Nespresso pod coffee (compostable pods, so fuck off)
- Dishwasher! No washing-up!
- Coronavirus plan: all the spend is fairly last minute, so we're not out of pocket if the festival is cancelled up until June.
